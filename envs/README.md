## Environment Specification Files

The files in this folder are used by Snakemake in running the workflow. We installed these conda environments directly, beacuse our snakemake implementation was having issues with creating new conda environments. So create the environments before runing the pipeline.

> **Note:**
> Please ensure that you launch the pipeline from within the snakemake environment as it has both Snakemake and Apptainer.
